        <h2>Editor's Note</h2>

        <p>I did not write this guide. I found it on the internet and wanted it to give it some love and make the self-quiz easy to do online. Living in New York City, I became more and more interested in good food, and I started to explore above and beyond my previous experience with fine dining. Out of a desire to learn more about etiquette after reading <a href="">this New York Times article</a>, I followed its suggestion to search for this woman's writing&mdash;and found it buried on a country club page that seemingly hadn't been updated since the 90s. I found it incredibly helpful, and approachable as well. I wanted to give it some love and make it more fun to work through. Table manners are not meant to exclude, but to instill you with a sense of ease. I hope you enjoy this resource and find practical guidance in it. </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>I wrote the first <em>Table Manners in Twenty Minutes</em> 
        because I didn't know which fork to use. I was an officer of an insurance 
        company and part of the job was attending lovely business dinners. I'd be 
        the only woman there, and the men would look to me for guidance. </p>
        <p>I was already nervous about the business issues, and then 
        to complicate matters, I didn't know which fork to use. It was very 
        intimidating.</p>

        <p>So, I decided to write a book on table manners. All my 
        friends said not to. "There are a million manners books out there, no one 
        wants another one!" But there was one person: me. If I was the only person 
        who benefited from the book, it would be enough.</p>
        <p>I wanted facts, not opinions, and they were very 
        difficult to find. I attempted to trace the rules of etiquette back to their 
        origins. I wanted to see why they developed and why they were proper. I also 
        wanted to know if these practices were still being observed.</p>
        <p>Manners evolve. What's acceptable and proper today, may 
        not be in ten years. Society changes, and with it, our needs and desires 
        change, all of which is reflected in our customs and manners. </p>
        <p>It was an issue of confidence for me. Now that I know 
        what's proper, I'm more comfortable in social situations. This knowledge has 
        given me the ability to decide if I want to observe a particular custom. 
        Sometimes I choose not to. </p>

        <p>For instance, I cut my lettuce and wear long gloves with 
        my strapless cocktail length dress. Neither of which was traditionally 
        considered proper. However, I do not ignore the basic principle of manners, 
        which is always being polite to other people. </p>
        <p>In this book, I've given you the closest thing to fact 
        there is, what was traditionally considered proper, and what is being observed today. From 
        there, it's your decision if you want to comply with them.</p>
        <p>Why did we come out with a revised edition instead of 
        simply reprinting the original book? I kept getting letters asking the same 
        questions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where do the salad plate and coffee cup go?</li>
          <li>When is it acceptable to wear a hat and gloves?</li>
          <li>What's the proper order of introductions?</li>
          <li>What's finger food, and what needs to be eaten with a fork?</li>
          <li>How much do you tip a wine steward, and all those other people in a restaurant?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I realized people wouldn't have to write to me if I 
        answered their questions in the first place. So, here we go with a new 
        improved <em>Table Manners in Twenty Minutes!</em></p>

      </section>

        <h2>Table Manners in 20 Minutes</h2>
        <!-- <p><em>2nd Revision</em></p> -->

        <p>Yes, only 20 minutes! It's just not that complicated when 
        you stick to "the rules.   People believe table manners are very complicated, 
        but many of them are common sense. The ones that aren't so obvious, we'll 
        cover in more detail. </p>

        <p><em>Manners,</em> as defined by Webster's, are ". . . morals, 
        social customs; breeding, social conduct, especially good." <em>Etiquette,</em> 
        as defined by Webster's, is ". . . the forms of conduct or behavior 
        prescribed by custom or authority to be observed in social, official, or 
        professional life." </p>
        <p>For our purposes, we'll define manners and etiquette as 
        the way to behave, which is polite, customary, or traditional, and in many 
        instances, will also avoid embarrassment.</p>

        <p>No one wants to look foolish by accidentally drinking out 
        of the finger bowl. The main reason to know the "rules" is to be kind, 
        polite, and inoffensive.</p>

      </section>

        <div class="content">
          The first rule of manners is never use your knowledge of manners and etiquette to put someone else down.
        </div>
      </blockquote>

    <div class="main content">

      <section>

        <p>If you do, you aren't using good manners yourself, and 
        you definitely aren't being kind. Only extremely rude people take pride in 
        knowing <em>"the rules"</em> and pointing out someone else's lack of knowledge 
        of the subject. They observe the letter of good manners, but not the spirit.
        </p>

        <p>Always remember the true test of good manners is the 
        ability to tolerate bad manners.</p>
        <p>With these basic ideas established throughout this book, 
        I will point out the traditional interpretation of proper etiquette. You 
        must know the strictest rules. This way, if you're with your grandmother's 
        friends, you'll know the rules with which they grew up. </p>
        <p>Who you're with will influence your behavior. Also, 
        always follow your hostess' lead (but don't spend the whole night staring at 
        her). She sets the pace.</p>

        <h3>Missing Manners</h3>
        <p>People who don't observe proper manners usually don't 
        know any better. Be patient with them, and never rude or condescending.</p>
        <p>If you're reading this book, you care about being polite. 
        You're trying to improve your knowledge on the subject. Unfortunately, not 
        everyone reads the same book, and some people never read a book on manners.
        </p>
        <p>Set an example for people. People will imitate you if you 
        are graceful, kind, and a joy to be with. </p>

        <p>The best hostess puts her feelings aside for those of her 
        guests. Her guests always come first. She notices and takes care of anything 
        that might make any of her guests uncomfortable. She is the epitome of 
        unselfishness. That doesn't mean she doesn't enjoy herself, just that she 
        makes sure her guests are enjoying themselves first.</p>
      
      </section>

      <section id="rsvp">
   
        <h2>R.S.V.P.</h2>

        <p>A formal dinner invitation will go out three to four 
        weeks ahead of time. Dinner will normally be at eight or eight thirty, but 
        it can range anywhere from six to nine. The invitation will probably say "R.S.V.P." 
        This is French for, <em>"Repondez s'il vous plait</em>," which in English, 
        means, "please respond." </p>

        <p>When you receive an invitation that says "R.S.V.P.", you 
        have a responsibility to tell your potential hostess whether or not you will 
        attend. Your hostess has asked you to respond, so she will know how many 
        people to expect. This is very important to her because she needs to plan 
        details, such as seating, how much to buy, and any needed help. </p>
        <p>People often fail to respond, or respond late. That is 
        extremely rude. The only thing worse is to fail to respond, and then show up 
        anyway. </p>
        <p>Your hostess needs to know how many people to plan for, 
        and if you don't respond, she'll have to assume you aren't coming. If you 
        then show up, she won't be prepared. </p>
        <p>The invitation will specifically say who is invited. If 
        it doesn't say "and family," your children are not invited. If you're 
        single, and it doesn't say "and guest," then you are not to bring an escort.</p>

        <p>Please don't call your hostess and ask her if you can 
        bring your children or your date. She hasn't invited them for a reason. It 
        may be she can't afford to entertain every single person's date, but she 
        wants you there. If you ask her if you can bring your date, she will 
        probably feel obligated to say yes, and then all the other single people 
        will wonder why their dates weren't invited. </p>

      </section>

      <section id="wear">
 
        <h2>What Do I Wear?</h2>

        <p>Your initial concern will be, "what do I wear?" If you're 
        going to a restaurant, and you haven't been there before, it's a good idea 
        to call ahead and find out what is acceptable. If you're going with another 
        couple, it's also a good idea to find out what the other couple is wearing.
        </p>

        <p>You don't have to ask the other couple what they intend 
        to wear, but it's nice to know if the other gentleman is going to wear a 
        tuxedo, so you can at least wear a dark suit and not a sportcoat. </p>
        <p>If you're going to someone's home, and they didn't 
        specify in the invitation what you should wear, simply call and ask what is 
        appropriate and what they will be wearing. (If the R.S.V.P. is to be by 
        phone, ask when you respond.) </p>
        
        <h3>White Tie</h3>
        

        <p>White tie is "formal attire." You don't see it very often 
        anymore. If you get an invitation that says "white tie," it means the man is 
        to wear a tailcoat, a white bow tie and a white vest. The shirt will have 
        winged collars, and he wears a waist coat not a cumber bund. </p>
        <p>The woman will then wear the most formal dress that is in 
        style at that time. Women's styles change much more quickly than men's, and 
        what is formal this year may not be next year.</p>
        

        <h3>Black Tie</h3>
        
        <p>Black tie is just below white tie in formality. You will 
        see this much more often than the formal white tie. Black tie was 
        traditionally called "informal." But today informal normally means
        casual. Black tie means the man is to wear a tuxedo, and 
        the woman wears an appropriate formal dress. The shirt will not have winged 
        collars, and it must be a pleated shirt, not ruffled. He may wear a cumber 
      bund or waist coat. </p>
        <p>You will frequently see "black tie optional." That means 
        if you own a tuxedo, you should wear it. If you don't, wear a dark suit. </p>

        <p>If the invitation just says "black tie," and you don't 
        own a tuxedo, rent one. Do not show up in a dark suit. </p>
        <p>If you're going to a wedding before six o'clock, don't 
        wear your tuxedo. You may, however, wear it to a wedding which takes place 
        after six o'clock.</p>
        <p>If you're sending an invitation, it is best to specify 
        white tie or black tie instead of formal or informal. Today, many people are 
        confused when they receive an invitation that says informal, "Now do they 
        mean black tie, or casual?"</p>

        <h3>Ascots</h3>
        
        <p>Ascots received their name from a sporting event, which 
        by nature makes them less formal than a tie. They may be worn for formal day 
        time events, and informal occasions with an open neck shirt. They should not 
        be worn in place of a tie for a formal evening event.</p>
        
        <h3>Women's Attire</h3>
        
        <p>There are very few things that are so black and white for 
        women. But there are a few, and they have to do with the colors black and 
        white.</p>
        <p>Can a woman wear black or white to a wedding? Black is 
        always appropriate for any dressy event, including a wedding. But many 
        people frown on white for wedding guests. They believe only the bride should 
        wear white. </p>
        <p>If you have another suitable dress that isn't white, select it instead. If the only nice dress you have is white, wear it anyway. The bride may not care, but she will care if you aren't at her wedding.</p>
        <p>When can you wear summer clothes, in particular, summer 
        white clothes and shoes? You can wear summer clothes and summer white 
        confidently between Memorial Day and Labor Day.</p>
        
        <h3>Gloves and Hats</h3>

        
        <p>The traditional rules governing hats and gloves are 
        different for men and women. </p>
        
        <h3>Women's Hats</h3>
        
        <p>Traditionally, a woman who wore a hat would also wear 
        gloves. She may wear a hat and gloves outside her own home, but not inside 
        her home. </p>
        <p>When a woman wears a hat, she does not need to remove it 
        until she returns home. In a theatre or somewhere similar, she may remove it 
        as a courtesy, since her hat may obstruct the view of someone behind her.
        </p>

        <p>A hat and gloves are perfect for weddings, luncheons, and 
        formal teas. A hat is not worn to a formal evening event. Instead, a woman 
        adorns her hair with jewels, flowers, or feathers.</p>
        
        <h3>Women's Gloves</h3>
        
        <p>Gloves do not require a hat. A woman wearing dress gloves 
        doesn't remove them when she goes inside, shakes hands, or dances. It used 
        to be said that only the queen leaves on her gloves when shaking hands. 
        Today, all women are permitted to leave their gloves on until they sit down 
        at the table.</p>
        <p>Gloves that go above the elbow (eighteen button gloves) 
        are worn with full length formals. Wrist length gloves and gloves that 
        extend to the elbow are worn with street length formals. Jewelry is worn 
        inside gloves. </p>

        <p>A woman removes her gloves when she sits down to eat or 
        have tea and before she arranges her napkin. Even if the woman is a guest in 
        someone else's home and is asked to pour the tea, she should remove her 
        gloves. She may place them on her lap, a nearby chair, or even on the floor, 
        but never on the table. The same holds true for a purse, never place it on 
        the table.</p>
        
        <h3>Men's Hats and Gloves</h3>
        
        <p>Men remove their hats when they go indoors. When a man 
        greets a woman outdoors, he raises his hat, and tips his head. Men wear 
        gloves outdoors only, never inside, and they never shake hands in them.</p>

        <h2>Precedence, or Who Goes First?</h2>
        
        <h3>On the Way There</h3>
        
        <p>Women go through doors first and down stairs last. If 
        there is any sort of potential difficulty, like in a crowd, the man goes 
        first. </p>
        <p>A gentleman walks on the street side when he's with 
        woman. The custom originated so he could block anything thrown up from the 
        street by a passing carriage. </p>

        <h3>Introductions</h3>
        
        <p>Introductions, handshakes, and guests of honor all have 
        one thing in common, the person who is senior in any way is first. A woman 
        before a man; an older person before a younger person; a person holding an 
        important office before your next door neighbor.</p>
        <p>When introducing two people, the name of the person who 
        is senior is said first. The name of a woman before a man, (unless he's the 
        President); an adult before a child; an older person before a younger 
        person. </p>
        <p>For instance, "William, this is my husband Mike Merchent. 
        Mike, this is William Shakespeare." The proper response to an introduction 
        is, "How do you do."</p>

        <p>Men rise during an introduction. Ladies rise for someone 
        of considerably higher rank than themselves, by age or office. It isn't 
        necessary for a woman to rise when meeting a contemporary. A hostess, 
        however, must always rise to meet her guests. </p>
        <p>A gentleman never sits when a lady is standing. If a 
        woman comes by your table and stays for a long time, a gentleman may sit 
        only if he invites her to join them, and she does sit down. A lady will find 
        a reason to sit down so the men may also. It is best if time spent at 
        another table is brief. </p>
        
        <h3>Handshakes</h3>
        
        <p>Handshakes used to follow a similar order. The person 
        senior in any way offered their hand first. An older man offered his hand to 
        a younger man, a woman to a man, an older woman to a younger woman, and so 
        on. Some people still follow this practice. </p>

        <p>Today, more commonly, offering your hand is considered a 
        gesture of friendliness, not disrespect. A man may offer his hand to another 
        man when they meet, regardless of age. Men shake hands when they meet. For 
        women, it's optional. The man used to wait for the woman to offer her hand, 
        but men frequently offer their hand to a woman, and it's considered 
        friendly.</p>
        <p>If you're uncomfortable as to whether or not you should 
        offer your hand, follow the traditional order of precedence. Most people 
        consider offering your hand a friendly gesture. Someone that is much older, 
        or extremely distinguished, may expect to have the privilege of deciding 
        whether or not to offer her hand.</p>
        
        <h3>Guests of Honor</h3>
        
        <p>You will hear a lot about guests of honor in all the 
        etiquette books, including this one. It sounds a little bit like people go 
        around having parties for each other and honoring each other all the time. 
        Well, in fact, as you probably know, that isn't the case.</p>

        <p>When I refer to the guest of honor, I mean it in a more 
        open sense. I simply mean the guest who deserves the honor, or who you defer 
        to. How do you decide who you should give the honors to? (For instance, this 
        comes up in seating, and who orders first.) It's simple. </p>
        <p>If you're with the boss' wife, she gets the honors. If 
        you're with an older woman, she receives the honors. If you're with a senior 
        woman in any way, give her the honors. And when you simply don't know what 
        to do, be gracious, and give the other woman (or man) the honors. No one 
        would ever consider you rude for honoring them in some way. </p>

      <section id="seated">

        <h2>Being Seated</h2>

        <p>If you have cocktails before dinner, leave them there. 
        Bring them to the table only if the hostess suggests it.</p>
        
        <h3>In Someone's Home</h3>

        
        <p>At a formal dinner, the host offers his arm to the female 
        guest of honor, and they go into the dining room. The hostess and her dinner 
        partner, the male guest of honor, enter last.</p>
        <p>If there aren't place cards, the hostess will tell you 
        where she would like you to sit. If there are place cards, the women sit 
        down as soon as they find their places. Each man pulls out the chair for the 
        woman on his right. The men sit down after the hostess is seated.</p>
        
        <h3>In a Restaurant</h3>
        
        <p>The person who made the reservations should tell the 
        hostess your party has arrived. You will then be seated. The female follows 
        the waiter and is seated first. </p>

        <p>The hostess tells the guests where she would like them to 
        sit. She will begin with the female guest of honor, if there is one. </p>
        <p>If the waiter doesn't pull out the chair for the ladies, 
        the gentlemen should. Again, the man pulls out the chair for the woman on 
        his right. </p>
        
        <h3>The Seating Plan</h3>
        
        <p>The host and hostess sit at the ends of the table, the 
        hostess sits at the end closest to the kitchen if at her home. The female 
        guest of honor sits to the right of the host, and the male guest of honor to 
        the right of the hostess. The seats of the next highest honor are to the 
        left of the host and hostess. At a booth, the females sit on the inside of 
        the booth. </p>

        <p>If it works out where the seating is male/female, the 
        host and hostess sit at opposite ends of the table. If not, the host sits in 
        his traditional seat at the end of the table. The male guest of honor may 
        sit across from him in the hostess' seat. The hostess then sits to his left.
        </p>
        <p>Husbands and wives are not seated together. If there is 
        more than one table, they should be seated at different tables, and the host 
        and hostess would also sit at separate tables. </p>
        
        <h3>You're Seated</h3>
        
        <p>You're now seated at the table, the hostess (if there is 
        one) puts her napkin in her lap first, and everyone else follows suit. 
        Remember, always follow the lead of your hostess. </p>

        <p>Your general posture at the table should be a straight 
        back, with your hands in your lap, or forearms just resting on the table. 
        Don't put your elbows on the table (just like mom used to tell you).</p>
        
        <h3>Does the Gentleman Order for the Lady?</h3>
        
        <p>At a restaurant, you'll be asked if you would like 
        something to drink and if you're ready to see menus. The female guest of 
        honor always orders first.</p>
        <p>It used to be that the man always ordered for the woman. 
        This is no longer the case. Some women consider it an insult if a man orders 
        for her without asking her if she would like him to do so. </p>

        <p>The man should simply ask the woman, "Would you like me 
        to order for you?" It is fine if the man orders for the woman. It is also 
        perfectly acceptable if the woman orders for herself. </p>
        <p>All the women's orders should be taken first, and then 
        the men.</p>

        <h2>Do's and Don'ts</h2>

        <p>Some other general rules: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't blow on your food if it's hot.</li>
          <li>Don't play with your hair, and never comb it.</li>
          <li>Don't put on makeup. Everyone appreciates good grooming, just not at the table.</li>
          <li>Don't play with the silverware, plates, sugar, crumbs, or anything else.</li>
          <li>Don't make funny noises when drinking or eating.</li>
          <li>Be neat.</li>
          <li>Don't tip your chair back on two legs.</li>

          <li>Chew with your mouth closed.</li>
          <li>Don't lick your fingers.</li>
          <li>Don't wave your silverware around, with or without food 
          on it. And <em>never</em> point with your silverware!</li>
          <li>Don't burp, blow your nose, pick your teeth, or take 
          your shoes off.</li>

          <li>If you need to go to the bathroom, simply excuse yourself and go. Lay your napkin in your chair when you leave.</li>
          <li>Control your drinking. Getting drunk is not in good taste.</li>
          <li>Make conversation, and let other people talk about 
          themselves. Don't monopolize the conversation with talk about your 
          children, your most recent illness, or anything else.</li>
          <li>Be considerate of the people waiting on you, but that 
          doesn't mean you should tolerate poor service.</li>
          <li>Pass things (like the salt and pepper) to the right, or 
          counterclockwise. When you begin passing the salt and pepper, pass them 
          together.</li>

          <li>If someone asks you to pass something, and you haven't 
          used it, you may ask, "May I use the salt before I pass it?" </li>
          <li>Don't reach for things that are not <em>directly</em> in 
          front of your place setting. Ask the person by name who is sitting 
          directly in front of the salt (or whatever it is you want).</li>
          <li>Bring your food to your mouth. Don't bend over the 
          table to your food.</li>
          <li>When a woman returns to the table, it is considerate if 
          the men rise. They need not rise all the way, but part way as a gesture of 
          courtesy is acceptable.</li>

          <li>If someone wishes to taste your food, pass it on your 
          butter plate. </li>
          <li>Don't crumble crackers in your soup. </li>
          <li>
If something is broken, simply apologize, and make 
          every effort to replace. </li>
          <li>When passing something with a handle, turn it so the 
          handle faces the other person when they reach for it.</li>
          <li>Before you come to the table blot your lips with a 
          tissue (in the powder room) so you won't stain the linen napkin when you 
          use it.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="party">

        <h2>Party Conversation</h2>

        <p>Party conversation, should be light, non-threatening and 
        definitely fun. Give the person you're speaking to your undivided attention. 
        Also, keep a mental check that you aren't talking too much yourself. Make 
        sure at dinner that you speak with the person sitting on each side of you.
        </p>
        <p>Don't discuss politics, religion, money, or sex. Those 
        are very interesting subjects, but they're also emotional. A few glasses of 
        wine, and a discussion of politics can ruin a perfectly lovely party.</p>

        <p>You may say, "Tell me about yourself." But don't ask 
        "What do you do?" If you'd like to know how they're employed, and they 
        didn't offer, you may ask, "What is your profession?" It may be considered 
        impolite however, since not everyone is employed. If they told you anything 
        about themselves when you asked, they probably would have mentioned 
        employment.</p>
        <p>It is impolite to correct other people at anything, 
        whether it be table manners, speech, or golf. Some people may appreciate a 
        worthwhile comment, but be careful. The only time you should do so is when 
        you are alone, you know the person very well, and you deliver the message 
        with the utmost kindness. </p>

        
        <h5>When do you correct someone?</h5>
        <ol class="min">
          <li>If at all possible, when you're alone.</li>
          <li>When you will spare them further embarrassment.</li>
        
        </ol>

        <p>If it's something noticeable and embarrassing, like a 
        garment that is undone, or something on their face, tell them; don't wait 
        until you're in private, just try to do it quietly. </p>
        <p>When you discover something unpleasant has happened to 
        someone else, the best thing to say is "I'm sorry." </p>
        <p>When asked something you prefer not to discuss, you might 
        say, "That's somewhat private," and attempt to change the subject. When in 
        doubt, say "I don't know;" "I don't remember;" or, "I'm not sure." Even if 
        it's a subject you obviously know the answer to, it communicates your desire 
        for privacy. </p>

      <section id="setting">
        
        <h2>Setting the Table</h2>
        
        <p>The individual place setting for each person is called 
        the "cover" and includes silverware, china, crystal, and linen. The cover is 
        marked by a service (or place) plate. Each cover should allow for 16-20 
        inches in order to be comfortable, and not feel cramped. </p>
        <p>Silver should be well polished, linens clean, and china 
        and crystal spot free. The centerpiece should be short enough that guests 
        can easily see each other over it. </p>

        <p>Candlesticks are for nighttime, or late afternoon, when 
        the curtains are drawn. If candles are used in the evening, they are to be 
        lit. In the late afternoon, they are not.</p>
        
        <h3>Place Cards</h3>

        <!-- <img src="assets/images/orig/TableManners1.gif" width="274" height="60"> -->
        
        <p>Place cards can be centered on the napkin, or centered 
        above the service plate. They should be used whenever there are eight or 
        more people. If the guests don't know each other, it's helpful if the names 
        appear on both sides of the cards. </p>

        <img src="assets/images/place-card-sm.png" class="place-card">

        <p>If it's a small intimate gathering, you may use their 
        first name. If it is a more formal gathering, you may wish to use their 
        social title. Or you may choose to use their first and last name if you want 
        to be a little more personal, but you're afraid the first name alone will 
        not suffice.</p>

        <h3>Napkins</h3>
        
        <p>Napkins are laid in the center of the plate, unless the 
        first course is to be there when the guests are seated. In that case, the 
        napkin is placed to the left of the place setting.</p>
        <p>Napkin rings were originally intended for family 
        members. Each family member had a napkin ring, and returned their napkin 
        to the ring after each meal. The napkin ring identified the person's 
        napkin, so they could use the same one all week. Since that's what people 
        may think when they see a napkin ring, it may be best to use them for 
        family only.</p>

        <p>When you open the napkin, open it half way. When you 
        leave the table after dinner, place your used napkin loosely (don't refold 
        it) to the left of your plate. </p>
        <p>Paper napkins are for outdoor parties. Indoor dinner 
        parties require linen.</p>

        <h3>Butter Plates, Water Glasses, Coffee Cups, &amp; Salad Plates</h3>

        <img src="assets/images/table-labels.png" class="basic-setup">

        <p>Which butter plate is yours? Your butter plate is the one 
        on your left. Think of all the "leftovers" you keep in little "butter" 
        dishes in your refrigerator. </p>

        <p>When putting butter on your plate, it goes on your butter 
        plate with the butter knife, not directly onto your bread. The same with

        <p>When eating bread, break off one bite of bread at a time, 
        butter it, and eat it. Buttering the whole piece of bread is not proper. The 
        exception would be if the rolls, muffins, or bread are hot. If you don't 
        butter hot rolls right away, they'll cool off, and the butter won't melt.</p>
        <p>Butter plates traditionally were not used at a formal 
        dinner, because bread wasn't served. Today both bread and the accompanying 
        butter plates are acceptable. </p>

        <p>You're thirsty, and you don't know which water glass is 
        yours. The glass above your knife, or to the right of your plate, is your 
        water glass. Just remember that water ends in "R" for right. Water glasses 
        are placed directly above the knife, and other beverage glasses are placed 
        to the right and slightly in front of the water glass. </p>
        <p>Before you take a drink of water, blot your lips with 
        your napkin to remove excess lipstick or crumbs. Neither one would be very 
        attractive on the edge of a water glass. Make sure your mouth is empty 
        before you take a drink. </p>
        <p>If your coffee cup is already on the table, it will be on 
        your right, which is the same side all the other glasses go on. Coffee is 
        not served during a formal meal, but afterwards, and normally in a separate 
        room. Crooking your little finger when drinking from a cup is an old 
        fashioned affectation. This means it was done simply for show. Luckily, it 
        isn't done anymore. </p>
        <p>Always take your spoon out of a cup or tall glass. Place 
        it on the accompanying dish, or on your plate if necessary. Not on the 
        table. If there isn't an accompanying dish, you may place the spoon on 
        another plate. If there are no plates, leave it in the cup or glass.</p>

        <p>If the salad is served with the main course, the salad 
        plate will be set to your left. Just remember all food should be served from 
        the left, and all beverages should be served from the right. It makes sense 
        that glasses and cups are on the right, and plates are on the left.</p>
        <p>The place setting pictured in this section would 
        traditionally have been considered a less formal meal. It has a salad plate 
        and coffee cup, but no service plate, champagne flute, or place card. </p>

        <h2>Ordering Dinner and Wine</h2>
      
        <p>At a restaurant, the female guest of honor orders first, 
        unless she wishes for her escort to order for her. </p>

        <p>What if you can't pronounce what you want to order? 
        Normally if the name is in French or Italian, the description is in English. 
        Simply order by the English description. You don't have to know how to say 
        it in French. Or ask the person taking your order to pronounce it for you, 
        so you can say it the next time.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The server will collect your menus and ask you if you 
        want wine. </p>

        <p>The traditional rule when selecting a wine is white wines 
        with white meat such as chicken and fish, and red wines with red meat. That 
        is just the traditional rule. Today, you can order whatever you like. For 
        instance, many people now prefer white wine over red wine even if they're 
        having red meat. </p>

        <p>If you need advice, the wine steward can suggest a good 
        wine to complement your dinner. Never feel obligated to get wine. Some 
        people like it and some don't. You may wish to have cocktails with your 
        dinner, or you may prefer not to drink during dinner. There is also the 
        consideration of how much you want to spend, and a bottle of wine can add a 
        great deal to the bill. </p>
        
        <!-- <img src="assets/images/orig/TableManners3.gif" width="87" height="128"> -->


        <p>There are several different kinds of glasses. The person 
        serving you, whether you are at a restaurant or someone's home, will know 
        which glass should get the white wine and which glass the red. But we'll 
        spend just a few moments on it because they're held differently.</p>

        <p>If you're asked by the hostess to pour the wine, fill the 
        glass only one-third to halfway. If it's white wine, it will get warm if you 
        fill it too high, and even if it's red, many people swirl their wine to 
        enjoy the bouquet (aroma) of the wine. Swirling is considered an art, and it 
        cannot be done properly if the glass is too full.</p>

        <p>Toasts are very special and need to be kept to a minimum 
        to keep their significance. </p>

        <p>The person making the toast may rise to make the toast if 
        there are a great many people present. If it's a smaller gathering, they may 
        stay seated. </p>
        <p>The person making the toast raises his glass, says 
        something pleasant about the person he's toasting, or even "To Mr. and Mrs. 
        Smith!" Everyone raises their glass, clinks them gently, and takes a drink 
        in honor of the person being toasted.</p>
        <p>During a toast, the person being toasted does not raise 
        his glass or take a drink, he simply remain seated with a polite smile. Only 
        after the person making the toast has said his kind words, and everyone else 
        has taken a sip, does the person being toasted say thank you, then drinks.</p>

        <h2>Serving</h2>

        <p>The female guest of honor is served first. All food is 
        served from the left, and all beverages from the right. When being served at 
        a home, the server moves counter clockwise, or to the right. </p>
        <p>The server serves with the left hand, and picks up with 
        the right hand. Dishes can be removed from either side, and they should be 
        removed singly, not stacked. </p>
        <p>At a formal meal, there is always a plate in front of 
        each person. The first is the service plate. The first course is placed on 
        it, and when it is removed, the service plate remains. When the next course 
        is served, the two plates are exchanged.</p>
        <p>If you are taking things from a serving dish, the spoon 
        goes under the food, and the fork, tines down, holds it from above to steady 
        it. The tines are the teeth.</p>
        <p>When putting food on your plate from a serving plate, the 
        intent is to keep the food on the serving plate clean. If you use a serving 
        utensil on your food, it isn't clean anymore. </p>

        <p>Most people believe it's correct to put gravy right onto 
        your meat or potatoes, so long as the serving utensil does not touch the 
        food. Not everyone agrees with this, so consider who you are with before you 
        put the gravy directly onto your potatoes.</p>
        <p>The table should have all plates and salt and pepper 
        removed before dessert is served. </p>

        <h3>When Do I Start?</h3>

        <p>Wait until the hostess lifts her fork as the signal to 
        begin eating. If there isn't a hostess, the female guest of honor lifts her 
        fork as the signal. If that doesn't apply, simply wait until everyone is 
        served, and then one of the women <em>(if there are any)</em> will pick up her 
        fork, and <em>everyone should follow her lead.</em></p><em>

        </em>
        <p>If the hostess says, "please go ahead," you're obliged to 
        take her at her word. (Otherwise, everyone's food starts getting cold.) </p>

        <h3>One Bite at a Time</h3>

        <p>Take small bites. Then, if someone asks you a question 
        while your mouth is full, it's only a moment before you're able to answer.</p>
        <p>Scoop up one mouthful at a time on your fork or spoon. If 
        you take more than one mouthful, another is left. It's unattractive to have 
        half eaten food remaining on the silverware.</p>

        <h2>What Course is Next?</h2>
      
        <p>Over the years, the order in which food is served has 
        changed. Since the silverware is set to follow that order, you have to see 
        how the restaurant or hostess serves their courses before you know which 
        silverware to use. </p>
        <p>Let's go over today's courses first, then in the next 
        section we'll discuss which silverware to use. (Don't be afraid. It's all 
        very simple.) The courses for a traditionally formal meal are discussed <a href="#formal">here</a>. </p>
        
        <p><strong class="special">First course</strong> - Normally seafood or soup, which can be 
        hot or cold. This course is the appetizer. The seafood and soup may also be 
        served separately. </p>
        
        <p><strong class="special">Second course</strong> - Traditionally, this course was the 
        main course of fish, meat, or chicken. However, now it is much more common 
        for salad to be served as the second course. </p>
        
        <p><strong class="special">Sorbet</strong> (pronounced <em>soar-bay</em>) - Many fine restaurants 
        now serve a sorbet after the salad to cleanse your palate before your main 
        course. (That just means it freshens your taste buds so the dressing from 
        the salad doesn't overpower your dinner.) </p>

        <p>Sorbet is simply a tiny bit of ice cream or sherbet, 
        (similar to ice cream but much lighter) in a tiny little serving bowl or 
        glass. It is usually served with its own tiny spoon. If not, use the dessert 
        spoon above your plate. In some restaurants, you don't order this course, 
        they just bring it to you. It's a lovely idea. </p>

        <p><strong class="special">Third course</strong> - is now normally the meat, fish, or 
        chicken. The salad used to be served at this point, and some hostesses and 
        restaurants still do so. It is also acceptable to have the salad and main 
        course served at the same time. </p>
        
        <p><strong class="special">Fourth course</strong> - is usually dessert. </p>

        <p>Between courses, the server may remove the crumbs on your 
        table for you. This is done with a clean napkin and a plate, a small 
        scraper, or even a small roller that will brush the crumbs up.</p>

        <p>Your food comes, and you panic because you don't know 
        which fork to use. The rule is start with the fork on the outside. That 
        isn't reassuring enough for many people, so let's go into a little more 
        detail.</p>
        <p>The silver is set in the order it is to be used, with the 
        first course's silver being on the outside. Forks (tines up) on the left, 
        knives (cutting edge pointing in), and spoons on the right. </p>
        
        <p><em>Remember, if the silverware you need isn't on the table 
        when you sit down, they will bring it when that course is served.</em></p>

        <p><strong class="special">Seafood fork</strong> - This fork is the smallest fork. It 
        will have only three tines. (Tines are the teeth.) It's used with seafood, 
        such as oysters and shrimp. It may be found to the far left of your place 
        setting, or it may be resting in the head of your far right soup spoon. </p>

        <p><strong class="special">Salad fork</strong> - This fork is larger than the seafood 
        fork, but smaller than your dinner fork. It will have four tines but will be 
        shorter and fatter than your regular fork.</p>

        <p><strong class="special">Dinner fork</strong> - This fork will look like the ones 
        you're used to seeing at home (may be called a place fork).</p>


        <p><strong class="special">Dessert fork</strong> - This fork is smaller than your regular 
        fork, and you can recognize it by its placstrongent. It will either be above 
        your plate, or it will be set at the table during dessert.</p>

        <p><strong class="special">Soup spoon</strong> - This spoon will normally be at the far 
        right of your place setting or will be delivered with the soup. 
        Traditionally there were two different types of soup spoons; one for the 
        cream soup and one for any other soup. The cream soup spoon had a round 
        head, and the other soup spoon was shaped a little more like a teaspoon. 
        This spoon may be used as the place spoon. </p>

        <p><strong class="special">Iced tea spoon</strong> - This spoon is longer than a regular 
        spoon, and the head may be a little smaller than the teaspoon. </p>


        <p><strong class="special">Teaspoon</strong> - This spoon will look like the ones you 
        normally see at home.</p>

        <p><strong class="special">Dessert spoon</strong> - This spoon is to be used with dessert 
        and will either be above your plate, or it will be placed on the table at 
        dessert.</p>

        <p><strong class="special">Dinner knife</strong> - This knife is like the one you're 
        familiar with at home (may be called a place knife).</p>


        <p><strong class="special">Fish knife</strong> - This knife is used with the fish course 
        seen in very formal dinners. It has a sharp point used to remove bones. The 
        separate fish course isn't seen much in this country.</p>

        <p><strong class="special">Salad knife - </strong>This knife is a bit small than your 
        dinner knife and is used to cut your salad if necessary. They make cutting 
        your salad acceptable, yea!</p>

        <p><strong class="special">Steak knife</strong> - This knife is sharper and may have a 
        serrated edge so you can cut meat with it.</p>


        <p><strong class="special">Butter spreader</strong>- This knife is smaller and is found 
        on your butter plate. It is used to butter your bread.</p>
        <p>Why isn't all the silverware on the table when you sit 
        down? It is inappropriate to set the table with more than three forks and 
        three knives. Seafood forks and butter spreaders aren't counted when 
        checking the three-piece maximum. So, if there is a seafood fork to the 
        right of the spoons, you could have actually four forks.</p>
        
        <h3>What do you call silverware made of silver?</h3>
        

        <p>Silverware is also called <em>flatware</em>. So silverware made of 
        silver is <em>sterling flatware</em>. Spoons, forks, knives, and serving utensils are 
        all considered flatware. Knives used to be called cutlery and were not 
        considered flatware. Today knives are also considered flatware. </p>
        <p>Sterling is flatware made primarily from sterling silver. 
        Silver plate has a coating of silver over a base metal. Gold electroplate is 
        similar to silver plate in that it is a plate of gold over a base metal. </p>
        <p>Stainless flatware is made of a stronger metal, and 
        requires less care since it can go in the dishwasher. Sterling and 
        silver plate should be washed by hand, although I use my sterling every day, 
      and I put it in the dishwasher. </p>
        <p>There used to be a condescending saying, "They're 
        the type who buy their silver." The implication was that people from the 
        right families inherited their silver. Inheriting silver is 
        wonderful, but many people don't inherit it and would like to have it 
        anyway. </p>

        <p>There isn't anything wrong with buying your own silver. 
      It's wonderful if someone else gives it to you, but if they don't, that 
      doesn't have to keep you from having it. </p>
        <p>Registering when you get married is the perfect opportunity to pick things you 
        may have trouble acquiring on your own. That doesn't 
        necessarily mean you'll get what you ask for, but if you don't ask for it, 
        it is unlikely you will get it. Also, you don't have to register for every 
        thing that appears on the registry list. Only register for what you 
        want and need. </p>
        <p>When you're buying someone a wedding present, 
        always buy something for which they have registered. The couple went to a 
        lot of trouble to pick very specific things they want and need. If you buy 
        them something else, it may not be in their taste. </p>

        <p>That will leave them in a bind, because they'll probably 
        keep whatever you give them. In addition, they may feel obligated to display 
        your gift. Just remember how varied people's tastes are, and if at all 
        possible select a gift they've already selected by registering!</p>

        <h2>Fork, Spoon, Knife or Fingers?</h2>
        
        <p><em>When in doubt, use your fork.</em> It's preferred over 
        fingers, spoons, and yes, even knives! If you can eat or cut something with 
        your fork, do so. </p>

        <p>If you're at a formal dinner, it's the obligation of the 
        hostess to serve food you can eat without embarrassment. For instance, corn 
        on the cob would never be served at a formal dinner. The corn would be 
        removed from the cob and served creamed or buttered.</p>
        <p>If you're dining at a formal restaurant, they won't have 
        pizza on the menu, but there will be foods that can be difficult to eat, 
        like lobster. If you order lobster, you must be able to remove it from the 
        shell delicately. </p>
        <p>A lovely restaurant will probably remove it for you, but 
        what if they don't? Lobster served in the shell, has to be removed with the 
        tools provided, and it may require your hands. If you don't think you can 
        manage it confidently, order something else. </p>
        

        <h3>Forks</h3>
        
        <p>Use a fork on cakes, fish, frozen ices, game, meats, 
        oysters, pies, salads, and vegetables. A fork is preferred even for ice 
        cream, and there is a new ice cream fork that is round like a spoon, but has 
        tines on the end. </p>
        <p>Asparagus - some say fingers, most say forks. To eat it 
        with a fork, use the blunt edge to cut it into bite size pieces. </p>
        <p>Spaghetti is eaten with a fork only. The fork is used to 
        twirl the spaghetti against the side of the pasta bowl or dish. It isn't cut 
        up, and a spoon does not assist the twirling of the noodles. </p>
        

        <h3>Spoons</h3>
        
        <p>Spoons are for coffee, tea, soup, bouillon, custard, 
        pudding, soft desserts, but not vegetables. </p>
        <p>Eat from the side of your spoon, not the tip. </p>
        <p>Spoons stir tea or coffee, but don't drink with them. 
        After you have stirred your beverage, remove the spoon from the glass or 
        cup. Place it on the serving plate beneath the glass or on the saucer 
        beneath the cup. It does not go on the table cloth. If the glass does not 
        have a dish under it, place the spoon on your plate.</p>
        <p>If soup is served in a soup plate, leave the soup spoon 
        in the soup plate and not on the service plate below. </p>

        
        <h3>Knives</h3>
        
        <p>Knives are used to cut. They are not raised to the mouth 
        and definitely don't go into the mouth. Anything that can be cut with a 
        fork, should be. Use the knives only when necessary.</p>
        <p>Cut and eat one piece at a time. Never cut someone else's 
        food, unless there are odd circumstances, such as a broken arm that prevents 
        them from doing it themselves, or in the case of a child.</p>
        

        <h3>Fingers</h3>
        
        <p>It depends on how formal the meal, and how difficult the 
        food is to eat. In a casual situation, such as a cook out or a family 
        dinner, things like chicken, pizza, and ribs may be eaten with the fingers. 
        Use good judgement. Some things are obviously intended to be eaten with your 
        fingers, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Artichokes leaves are eaten with the fingers; the 
            heart with a fork and knife. </li>

          <li>Bread is eaten one bite size piece at a time.</li>
          <li>Candy, celery, cherries, cookies, corn on the cob, 
            nuts, olives, potato chips, radishes, and sandwiches are also eaten with 
            your fingers. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="appropriate">

        <h2>Is it Appropriate to . . .</h2>
        
        <h3>Tip Your Soup Bowl</h3>
      
        <p>When eating soup, dip the spoon away from you, not 
        towards you. You may tilt your soup bowl, as long as you tilt it away from 
        you. The same rule applies for the dessert if served in a bowl.</p>

        <p>When you're finished eating your soup, lay the spoon on 
        the edge of the plate it sits on. If it's not on a plate, leave it in the 
        bowl. Do not put it on the tablecloth. </p>
        
        <h3>Cut the Lettuce in your Salad</h3>
        
        <p>Can you cut your lettuce? Traditionally, the answer was 
        "No." You used your fork to fold the leaves into bite size pieces, or the 
        edge of your fork to cut it. Today, if there's a salad knife, it's 
        acceptable to cut your lettuce. </p>

        <p>It's believed the reason it was considered offensive was 
        because knives weren't made of stainless steel, and the dressing's vinegar 
        stained and discolored the knives. That is no longer the case, but some 
        people still cling to the old rule. Remember to consider whom you're with 
        when deciding what is appropriate.</p>
        
        <h3>Take Something out of Your Mouth</h3>
        
        <p>If you need to take something out of your mouth, the 
        traditional rule is, the way it went in, is the way it comes out. That 
        simply means if a piece of watermelon went in your mouth on a fork, the 
        watermelon seeds come out on your fork. If something goes in your mouth with 
        your fingers, like a fresh cherry, then the pit comes out in your hand.</p>

        <p>If you are uncomfortable using your fork to take 
        something out of your mouth, you may remove something with your thumb and 
        forefinger into a cupped hand. Then set it on the edge of your plate. If you 
        need to remove something that has become lodged between your teeth, wait 
        until you're alone to do so.</p>
        <h3>Cutting</h3>
        <p>The American way of cutting is with the fork in your left 
        hand and the knife in your right hand. Then lay the knife on the edge of the 
        plate and move the fork to your right hand. Put the bite in your mouth with 
        the tines facing up.</p>
        <p>The European method is to cut with the knife in your 
        right hand, fork in your left, and then lifting the fork still in your left 
        hand to your mouth, tines down. The knife stays in your right hand all the 
        time. Either method is acceptable.</p>

        <p>Cut one piece at a time. Eat it, and then cut another. 
        Between bites, lay your silverware down on your plate. It will keep you from 
        inadvertently waving your silverware around when you talk with your hands.</p>

        <h3>I Dropped my Fork!</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, if you dropped a piece of silverware, you 
        were to leave it where it fell and simply tell a server, so they can bring 
        you another. Today if you drop a piece of your silverware, and it is easily 
        within reach, it's all right to pick it up. Give it to the serving person, 
        and ask for another. If it is out of your reach, under the table, or someone 
        else's chair, simply tell the server, and they will bring you another. 
        (Don't use silverware that has fallen on the floor.)</p>
        <p>In between eating, lay your silverware on your plate <!-- as 
        shown --> here. Do not lay used silverware on the tablecloth. </p>

        <p>If a little bit of food gets on the table, you may pick 
        it up with the edge of your knife, and place it on the edge of your plate.
        </p>
        <p>If a server has spilled something, they attend to it. If 
        it is something a guest has spilled, and it is quite a mess, the guest 
        simply apologizes, and allows it to be cleaned up.</p>

        <h2>A Traditionally Formal Meal</h2>

        <p>At a traditionally formal meal, there is no butter plate, 
        or dessert soon and fork. Bread traditionally was not served with formal 
        meals, and the dessert fork and spoon would be presented with the finger 
        bowls. </p>
        <p>Below are a few variations of formal meals. If you are 
        hosting a formal meal, and you don't see a variation here you like, simply 
        delete the courses you don't wish to serve. For instance, the separate fish 
        course is rarely seen in the United States, however it is very common in 
        Europe. Also at a formal meal, coffee is served in another room, not the 
        dining room.</p>
        <p>Sherry was served with the soup; a dry white wine with 
        the fish. Red wine was served with meat, duck, and game. Champagne was 
        served with dessert. If you've never had champagne and chocolate together, 
        try it. It is absolutely fabulous!</p>

        <h3>Finger Bowls</h3>

        <p>These aren't very common anymore but you will still 
        occasionally see them, especially if something messy like mussels or lobster 
        is served.</p>
        <p>A finger bowl will normally be brought after the main 
        course. It will come on a dessert plate and will probably have a doily 
        underneath. Simply dip your fingers (not your whole hand) in the water, and 
        dry your fingers on your napkin. In restaurants, they will provide you with 
        another napkin to be used with your finger bowl.</p>
        <p>The finger bowl may also be presented with the dessert 
        fork and spoon on either side of the same dessert plate <!-- (as shown in this 
        picture) -->. </p>

        <p>If so, after you've used the finger bowl, move the dessert spoon and fork to the table on either side of your plate<!--  (as shown) -->. Then lift the finger bowl and doily and place them above your plate and to the left. </p>
        <p>If the finger bowl isn't served with the dessert spoon 
        and fork, simply leave it where it is. A server will come and take it away.
        </p>

      <section id="finished">

        <h2>I'm Finished</h2>

        <p>You've finished eating. Now what do you do with the 
        silverware that you were so worried about? You place it on your plate in one 
        of these two ways (tines up). Never put a dirty piece of silverware on the 
        tablecloth.</p>
        <p>Don't push your plate away when you're finished eating. 
        Simply leave it where it is. Someone will come and take it soon enough. 
        Also, don't announce, "Boy am I stuffed," or "I couldn't eat another bite if 
        I had to." Anything like that is considered rude. It is appropriate to say, 
        "What a lovely meal this has been!" or something similar.</p>

        <p>Keep your napkin on your lap until you are ready to leave 
        the table. (It doesn't look very pretty right now.) When you're ready to 
        leave the table for the evening, simply lay it loosely beside your place. 
        You don't need to refold it.</p>

        <h3>Doggie Bags</h3>

        <p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking for 
        something to be wrapped up so you can take it home, that is, if you're in a 
        restaurant. I wouldn't recommend it if you are a guest in someone's home!</p>

        <p>Also, if you're a guest in someone's home, and they serve 
        a dish you really enjoy, it's considered a compliment by most people if you 
        ask them for the recipe. However, on occasion, they may not be willing to 
        give it to you if it's a family secret. So don't have your feelings hurt.</p>

        <h3>Splitting the Check</h3>

        <p>If you are splitting the check with another couple or a 
        friend, simply split it down the middle, and don't worry about the exact 
        amount each of you spent. The exception to this would be if someone will be 
        cheated because they had a dinner salad, and you had a four- course dinner. 
        In this case, make a fair estimate each person should contribute. </p>

        <p>Don't haggle over the check. If you wish to pay for 
        someone's dinner, it should be established that you are treating before you 
        eat. Don't argue afterwards who is going to treat.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="tipping">

        <h2>Tipping</h2>

        <p>People simply don't agree on this subject. The name 
        originally came from an abbreviation. Each letter in the word "tips" stood 
        for the first letter in each word in the phrase "<u>T</u>o <u>I</u>nsure <u>

        P</u>roper <u>S</u>ervice." If you received proper service, you left a good 
        tip. If you received poor service, you left a poor tip.</p>
        <p>If you receive good service, 15 to 20 percent is 
        considered a good tip, and your waiter or waitress will calculate exactly 
        what percent you gave them. So it does matter. </p>
        <p>What if you receive poor service? This is where the 
        disagreements begin. What is a good tip, what is a bad tip, and what is 
        unacceptable? If you've ever been a waiter or waitress, you're more likely 
        to be lenient. People who haven't waited on tables seem to be less lenient.
        </p>

        <p>Some people believe you should never leave less than 10 
        percent no matter how bad the service was. Other people say if the service 
        was really bad, leave no tip or leave a penny. The reason people sometimes 
        leave a penny is so the waiter or waitress knows the client didn't forget to 
        leave a tip but was unhappy with the service.</p>
        <p>If you're really unhappy with the service, leave a tip of 
        10 percent or less, and simply write to the restaurant management. </p>
        <p>What about all those other people in a restaurant? <em>The 
        only time you give people (besides your server) a tip is when they go out of 
        their way to provide you a service, or they give you a lot of attention.</em> 
        Simply seating you and handing you a menu does not qualify someone for a 
        tip. </p>
        <p>At a restaurant, for the proper service you may wish to 
        give:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong class="special">Valet Parking</strong> - 50 cents to $1. </li>
          <li><strong class="special">Coat Check</strong> - $1.</li>
          <li><strong class="special">Restroom attendants</strong> - 50 cents to $1.</li>
          <li><strong class="special">Head waiter or Maitre'd</strong> - may be given $5-10 if his service deserved it. Hand it to him as you leave.</li>
          <li><strong class="special">Wine steward</strong> - up to 15 percent of the cost of the wine.</li>
          <li><strong class="special">Doormen</strong> - $1 for hailing a cab.</li>
          <li><strong class="special">Skycaps</strong> - $1 per bag.</li>
          <li><strong class="special">Room service, hairdressers, and taxis</strong> - 15 percent of the bill.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>Calculating the Tip</h3>
      
        <p>Tips should be based on the bill including the drinks 
        before tax is added. If you want to leave 20 percent, simply multiply the 
        bill by 10 percent and double it. When you multiply by 10 percent, you just 
        move the decimal one place to the left. If the bill was $35, 10 percent 
        would be $3.50, and 20 percent would be twice that or $7.</p>
        <p>If you want to leave 15 percent, just take the 10 percent 
        and add half again as much. So if the bill is $35, take $3.50 and add $1.75 
        to get $5.25. Or if you don't want to remember all that, just cut out the 
        tip chart, and put it in your wallet!</p>
